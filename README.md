<h1>Web Scraping using httpx and selectolax</h1>

<h3>httpx</h3>
  Used to make http requests and fetch responses , better than its counterpart requests library since httpx has both synchronous and asynchronous capabilities.httpx can also handle both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 requests.

<h3>Selectolax</h3>
  Used to extract required data from the html parsed response using appropriate CSS selectors.
